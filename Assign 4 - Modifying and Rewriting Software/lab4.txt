ASSIGNMENT 4: MODIFYING AND REWRITING SOFTWARE

######LAB: Small Change to Big Package

VERIFY PROBLEM STILL OCCURS
1. Created bash script that contains:
#!/bin/sh
exec ls -a "$@"

2. Noticed that './la -A' and 'ls -a -A' output the same files.

3. Used 'man ls' to check that GNU Coreutils is version 8.22.


WORKING WITH COREUTILS 8.29

1. Retrieve the compressed tarball, and all necessary files 
   mkdir coreutilsResource
   cd coreutilsResource
   wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
   wget	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
   wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

   Unzip the tarball
   tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

   Verify signature with the keyring
   gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

Given Output:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

There seems to be a warning about the validity of the signature.
This is attributed to the fact that we are using a public key, which has not
been verified.

2. Compile and install Coreutils
   echo $PWD   Used to see the directory path
   cd coreutils-8.29
   
   Running the configure script and make command to compile, create makefiles
   ./configure --prefix=/u/ma/ugrad/zacharyc/cs35L/Lab4/coreutilsResource
   make
   make install

   Check if installed correctly
   cd ..
   cd bin
   ls		Found many commands in here typically used in Linux 

3. Reproduce the bug with the installed ls command
   ~/cs35L/Lab4/coreutilsResource/bin/ls -a -A

Given Output:
.   bin		    coreutils-8.29.tar.xz      gnu-keyring.gpg	share
..  coreutils-8.29  coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig  libexec

Notice that the . and .. directories are still shown, which means that 
the -a flag still overpowers the -A flag.

4. Applying the patch
   First use Copy-paste to retrieve the patch from the post
   Navigate to the bug patch for Bug#30963 and copy paste into a new file
   emacs lsp.diff

   Apply the patch
   patch -p1 < lsp.diff

ERROR MESSAGES
patching file NEWS
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
Hunk #1 FAILED at 575.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file tests/local.mk.rej
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

This does not prevent the modified coreutils from working. This could be 
attributed to simple spacing discrepancies.


5.
Run make (modifications output listed below)
  CC       src/ls.o
  CCLD     src/dir
  CCLD     src/ls
  CCLD     src/vdir
  GEN      man/dir.1
  GEN      man/ls.1
  GEN      man/vdir.1

Only the necessary commands were run for each simply because these
were the only files that needed to be updated. The autoreconf 
command was not needed in this scenario. This command is only used
in case the make command does not work.

6. Testing that it works
   ~/cs35L/Lab4/coreutilsResource/bin/ls -a -A

Given Output:
bin	coreutils-8.29.tar.xz	   gnu-keyring.gpg  share
coreutils-8.29			   coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig  libexec

Because both the . and .. files do not appear, we know the patch has worked.

######SETTING UP SSH-AGENT############

HOME: lnxsrv06, REMOTE: lnxsrv07

Commands: 
ls -a		 Check to see whether you do or do not have the .ssh directory
mkdir .ssh 	 If not, make the directory
cd .ssh 	 Go into the directory
ssh-keygen 	 Generate a key
CS35LKey	 Name it CS35LKey
*password*	 Type in password twice
ls 		 (notice that CS35LKey and CS35LKey.pub appear)


SETTING UP REMOTE SERVER
Open a new terminal window and ssh login into lnxsrv07
cd .ssh	   	    	       	      Notice that the CS35LKey and CS35LKey.pub files are there (share filesystem)
touch authorized_keys 	    	      Keep track of the authorized public keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys   	      Change permission to only read write by owner
ls -alt   		    	      (now it is -rw-------)
cat CS35LKey.pub >> authorized_keys   Append the public key to authorized_keys


ENSURE KEY FUNCTIONALITY
ssh -i CS35LKey zacharyc@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu		(-i means to use key identification) 
*password*						Type in passphrase made when creating the key

Summary so far: client have a public and private key, servers have public key, use private key to prove your identity


USE SSH-AGENT TO MAINTAIN TRUST
Ctrl-D 	      	 	  log out of lnxsrv07 and back to lnxsrv06
eval $(ssh-agent)	  needed to start ssh-agent

Now to add key to the ssh-agent
ssh-add CS35LKey
Enter the passphrase

ssh -i CS35LKey	zacharyc@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
No password prompt now!

Notice that when you log out, you still need to type "eval" and "ssh-add" again and enter passphrase, only once

1. man -k
   Shell commands:
   man man

2. mv can be found in /usr/local/cs/bin/mv, sh can be found in /usr/bin/sh
   Shell commands:
   man which
   which mv
   which sh
I used the commands above to figure out how to use the which command, then utilizing it to find the locations of mv and sh.

3. There are three executable programs that satisfy these conditions: tr, ar, and pr.
   tr - translates or delete characters
   ar - can create, modify, and extract from archives
   pr - converts text files for printing
   Shell commands:
   man find
   find /usr/bin/ -name "?r" -executable
   man tr
   man ar
   man pr
I looked through the find command's description and found that it could be modified to search according to a path, a file's name, and a file's name length, also specifying that it should be executable. Then I used the man command for each of the three executable programs I found.

4. /etc/alternatives/emacs is actually executed
   Shell commands:
   man -k symbolic
   readlink /usr/bin/emacs
I used the man -k command to find commands that have the word "symbolic." The readlink command can read the value of a symbolic link.

5. The version of /usr/bin/gcc is 4.8.5 while the version of the plain gcc program is 9.3.0. The versions are different simply because they are different files in different directories.
   Shell commands:
   /usr/bin/gcc -v
   gcc -v
   which gcc
Performing the "which gcc" command reveals that the plain gcc program has the following path: "/usr/local/cs/bin/gcc

6. The symbolic mode u+sx allows the user who owns the file permission to both set the user or group ID on execution and also to execute the file. The symbolic mode o-w means that the other users not in the file's group no longer have permission to write.
   Shell commands:
   man chmod
 
7. find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28. There are 446 directories that satisfy the conditions. Some examples are as follows:
/usr/local/cs
/usr/local/cs/src/git
/usr/local/cs/src/git/RCS
/usr/local/cs/src/coreutils
/usr/local/cs/src/coreutils/RCS
   Shell commands:
   man find
   find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28
   find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 | wc -l
You can specify path, modified time, and type of file in the find command.

8. 280 are symbolic links
   Shell commands:
   which find
   man find
   man wc
   find . /usr/bin/ -type l | wc -l
The "find ." command recursively searches through all files and subdirectories. Then specify the path and the type is symbolic links. wc -l counts the number of links. 

9. librom1394.so.0.3.0 is the oldest regular file
   Shell commands:
   man ls
   ls -alt /usr/lib64
-a does not ignore entries starting with . and -lt lists the files in a sorted order in a long listing format. Then, define the path.

10. /usr/share/i18n/locales 
   Shell commands:
   man locale

11. There are two commands with "downcase" in their name: downcase-region, downcase-word.
   Emacs commands:
   C-h
   a
   downcase

12. C-M-r: performs incremental search backward for regular expressions and regular string search for those with prefix arguments
    C-M-s: runs command isearch-forward-regexp; performs incremental search forward for regular expressions and regular string search for those with prefix arguments
    C-M-t: runs transpose-sexps
    C-M-u: runs upcase-word command; convert ARG words to upper case
    C-M-v: scrolls next window upward ARG lines or near full screen without ARG   Emacs commands:
   C-h k
   C-M-r
   C-h k
   C-M-s
   C-h k
   C-M-t
   C-h k
   C-M-u
   C-h k
   C-M-v

13. C-g: signal a 'quit' condition; runs command keyboard-quit; at top-level, this simply beeps.
   Emacs commands:
   C-h k
   C-g

14. The yank command can be invoked with C-y, and it reinserts the most recent kill (the stretch of killed text most recently killed or yanked).
   Emacs commands:
   C-h w
   yank
   C-h k
   C-y

15. The ls -l command does not display the "." and ".." hard links, but the dired command does show them at the top of the list of files.
   Shell commands:
   cd /usr/bin
   ls -l
   emacs
   Emacs commands:
   C-h f
   dired
   C-x d
